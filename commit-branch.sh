#
# A pathspec limits the commit to part of the tree. Without one the whole
# working tree is committed, which is what a state branch wants; with one, only
# what a build step is supposed to have produced, so a stray file written
# elsewhere cannot ride along unnoticed.
#
# A `git commit` in CI is unsigned unless a private key sits on the runner,
# which is not a trade worth making for a state branch. createCommitOnBranch
# builds the commit server-side and GitHub signs it, so the history is
# verifiable without a key ever leaving a person's machine. The author is
# whoever the token is -- github-actions[bot] under ${{ github.token }} --
# rather than an identity invented in a workflow file.
#
# The mutation takes explicit additions and deletions rather than a tree, so
# the diff is computed here. A missed deletion would leave a file on the branch
# forever, which is why the file set comes from git rather than a directory
# walk.
#
# expectedHeadOid makes the write conditional on the branch not having moved.
# The ingest is serialised by its concurrency group, so a mismatch means
# something genuinely unexpected happened and the run should fail.
